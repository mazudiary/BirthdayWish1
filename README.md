## 🌷✨ What’s Inside the Magic?

This enchanted multi-page journey takes you through the soft and sparkling world of love and celebration:

- 💌 **Index Page** – A warm welcome with floating hearts and a glassy invite.
- 🎆 **Celebration Page** – Dazzling fireworks, falling petals, and a special message.
- 🍰 **Cake Page** – Cut the cake together! Watch the candles glow and ribbons fall.
- 💖 **Card Page** – A flip of a card reveals a romantic message from the heart.

Each scene is animated with love (thanks to GSAP), set to a soothing melody, and styled in soft pastels for a perfect romantic vibe.
